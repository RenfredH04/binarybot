binarybot
=========

Binarybot is a simple and esoteric reddit bot that searches for comments that contain binary strings and translates them to their ASCII equivalents. He's not very useful, but he's proud of what he does. View binarybot's [reddit account](http://www.reddit.com/user/BinaryConversionBot/) to see some some of his examples of his work. 

Binarybot proudly uses the [praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) API wrapper.
